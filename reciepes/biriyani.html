     <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
     <ul>
         <li>Oil/Ghee</li>
         <li>Onions</li>
         <li>Bone-in, cut up, skinless chicken</li>
         <li>whole spices</li>
         <li>Garlic + Ginger</li>
         <li>tomato</li>
         <li>yogurt</li>
         <li>rice</li>
         <li>Dried Plums (Alu Bukhara)</li>
     </ul><hr> 
     <h3>Steps:</h3> 
     <ol>
         <li>Marinate the chicken in spices and yogurt. This infuses the chicken with noticeable flavor. Ideally, marinate overnight or for at least a couple hours, but I tested and found that it’s still very tasty if you marinate just before making the biryani.</li>
         <li>Take the chicken out of the fridge before you start preparing the biryani. Allowing the chicken to come closer to room temperature helps it cook more evenly and stay tender.</li>
         <li>Lastly, after sautéing the chicken in the hot oil, add water and allow the chicken to simmer gently, covered, over low heat.</li>
         <li>At 3 minutes, the rice still has a raw center.</li>
         <li>At 4 minutes, the center has mostly cooked, but the rice kernel is still tough.</li>
         <li>Around 5 minutes, the rice starts to swell and the rice is just-cooked. In between 5 minutes and 5:30 seconds is when it’s ideal to stop boiling the rice.</li>
         <li>At 6 minutes, the rice is cooked, but starts to break easily without getting mushy.</li>
         <li>    In between 7-8 minutes, the rice gets mushy once pressed between your fingers. This is a sign that it’s overcooked and is more likely to break during the ‘dum’ stage.</li>
