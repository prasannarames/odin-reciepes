    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p><h4>This classic French beef stew, otherwise known as Beef Bourguignon, is the ultimate comfort food. Chunks of well-marbled beef are seared in olive oil  and then gently braised with garlic and onions in a wine-based broth. After a few hours in the oven, the meat becomes meltingly tender and enveloped in a rich, deeply flavored sauce.

        It takes some time to make but I promise it’s well worth the effort. Aside from being delicious — it is my all-time most popular recipe — it’s a one-pot meal that feeds a crowd. You can also make it a day ahead; in fact, you should because the flavor improves the longer it sits.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3><hr>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds boneless beef chuck (well-marbled), cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>7 cloves garlic, peeled and smashed</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth </li>
        <li>/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 pound small white boiling potatoes (baby yukons), cut in half
            Fresh chopped parsley, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul><hr>
    <h3>Steps:</h3><hr>
    <ol>
        <li>first cut the beef whatever size you need.</li>
        <li>his step is a bit time-consuming but browning the meat adds depth and dimension to the stew. (Note: it’s important not to crowd the pan — if you try to brown all the meat at once, it will steam instead of sear and you won’t get all that lovely color and flavor.)</li>
        <li>Remove the meat and add the onions, garlic, and balsamic vinegar to the pan. The vinegar will loosen all the brown.</li>
        <li>Add the wine, broth, water, thyme, bay leaves, and sugar.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, add the carrots and potatoes.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and continue cooking for one hour, or until the meat is fork-tender, the broth is thickened, and the carrots and potatoes are tender.</li>
